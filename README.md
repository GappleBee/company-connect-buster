# Installation
- Go to your (hopefully Chromium-based) browser's extension page
- Enable developer mode
- Download the folder as a zip by going to `Code` and `Download ZIP`
- Unzip this folder 
- Go to your (hopefully Chromium-based) browser's extension page
- Go to `Load unpacked` 
- Select the unzipped folder (there may be a folder nested inside the one unzipped, make sure you select the folder that contains the files and not just another folder)
- If you've done this then the extension should be installed locally

# Usage
- Make sure the extension is enabled and you're logged in to Company Connect
- Go to any Company Connect page and it will (should) work its magic
